Each pixel in the result is achieved in exactly the same way. Then, we sum up the pixels in the result to get our vertical score. Here in our example, we get the vertical score/sum as -4. Thus, we know the pixel in question is part of a top vertical edge because we achieve the minimum value of -4.\n",
